<h1 class="first" style="font-variant: uppercase;">Hematuria (Blood in the Urine)</h1>
<h3><marquee>Hematuria is the presence of blood or blood cells in the urine.</marquee></h3>

<img src="im.jpg" class="Image">

<h3 class="third">CAUSES</h3>
<p>Causes of hematuria include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Urinary tract infection (UTI)</li>
<li>Pyelonephritis (UTI that has reached as far as the kidney)</li>
<li>Urinary stone disease</li>
<li>Enlarged prostate (benign prostatic hypertrophy)</li>
<li>Injury to the urinary tract</li>
<li>Kidney (renal) disease</li>
<li>Sickle cell disease</li>
<li>Bladder cancer</li>
<li>Kidney cancer</li>
<li>Prostate cancer</li>
</ul>

	<h3 class="third">SYMPTOMS</h3>
	<p>Although blood in the urine is not always a significant symptom of disease, it can be an important warning sign to a possible health problem.</p><p>

Bloody urine should never be ignored. Contact your doctor right away if there is blood in your urine, especially if you are also suffering from:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Frequent, painful or urgent urination</li><li>
Nausea, vomiting, fever, or pain in your abdomen</li></ul>


<h3 class="third">DIAGNOSIS</h3>
<p>Tests may include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Urinalysis: A test on a urine sample.</li>
<li>Urine culture: A urine test that checks for an infection.</li>
<li>Urine cytology: A urine test that checks for any abnormal appearing cells.</li>
<li>Cystoscopy: A test that uses a device called a cystoscope to look at the inside of the bladder and urethra.</li>
<li>Computed tomography (CT) scan: A test that uses X-rays and computers to make cross-sectional images of the abdomen and pelvis.</li>
</ul>

	<h3 class="third">TREATMENTS</h3>
<p>The treatment of hematuria depends strongly on the actual cause of blood in the urine. The information collected from the medical history, physical exam, and any test results will be used to determine the best treatment option.</p>
<p>For hematuria that is caused by a UTI, for example, a common treatment is the use of antibiotics. These antibiotics work to kill the bacteria causing the UTI, which should stop the bleeding.</p>
